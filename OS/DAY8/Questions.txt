1.Store the output of the command “hostname” in a variable. 
Display “This script is running on _.” where “_” is the output of the “hostname” command.

2.Write a shell script to check to see if the file “file_path” exists. If it does exist, display “file_path passwords are enabled.” Next, check to see if you can write to the file. If you can, display “You have permissions to edit “file_path.””If you cannot, display “You do NOT have permissions to edit “file_path””

3.write a shell script that prompts the user for a name of a file or directory and reports if it is a regular file, a directory, or another type of file. Also perform an ls command against the file or directory with the long listing option.

4.Modify the previous script to that it accepts the file or directory name as an argument instead of prompting the user to enter it.
